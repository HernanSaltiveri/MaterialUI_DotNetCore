# MaterialUI_DotNetCore
.Net Core 2.0 Material-UI 1.x Starter

This is a very simple starter package to get .Net Core & [MaterialUI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui) 1.x working together.  Any input / pull requests are greatly appreaciatied as I'd like this repo to become a Best-Practice example for using TypesScript 2.8+ Material-UI and .Net Core.

Updated for the release of Material UI 1.0.

Installation:

1.  npm install
2.  dotnet restore
