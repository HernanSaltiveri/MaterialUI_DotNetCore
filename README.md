# MaterialUI & DotNetCore
.Net Core 2.0 Material-UI 1.0.x Starter

This is a very simple starter package to get .Net Core & [MaterialUI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui) 1.x 
working together.  Any input / pull requests are greatly appreaciatied as I'd like this repo to become a Best-Practice 
example for using TypesScript 2.8+ Material-UI and .Net Core.

Updated for the release of Material UI 1.0.

Installation:

1.  npm install
2.  dotnet restore

### Includes

+ Material UI 1.0
+ TypeScript 2.8
+ React 16
+ Redux 
+ Fully supports WebpackDevMiddleware hot reload

Notes:

+ There is a lot of usage of 'any'.  This is only due to myself just now wrapping my head around TypeScript and not
knowing the proper syntax to get all of type checking working properly.
+ I don't suggest you to go down my route as it maybe not the best, I hope for some community support to help us out :)
